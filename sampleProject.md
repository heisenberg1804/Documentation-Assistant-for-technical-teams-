## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running locally for development and testing.

### **Prerequisites**

* **Git**
* **Docker** (`v20.0+`)
* **Docker Compose** (`v2.0+`)

### **Installation & Setup**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/photosphere.git](https://github.com/yourusername/photosphere.git)
    cd photosphere
    ```

2.  **Create an environment file:**
    Copy the example environment file and customize it if needed. For local development, the default values are usually sufficient.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3.  **Build and run the Docker containers:**
    This command will build the necessary Docker images and start all the services (web server, database, etc.).
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
    The initial build might take a few minutes. The `-d` flag runs the containers in detached mode.

4.  **Apply database migrations:**
    Run the initial database migrations to set up the schema.
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
    ```

The application should now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

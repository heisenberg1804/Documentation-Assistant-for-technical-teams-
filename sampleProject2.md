Low-Level Design: ‚öôÔ∏è Order Processing Service
This document provides a low-level design for the "Order Processing Service" microservice. It details the internal components, their responsibilities, data models, and interactions, outlining how the service processes and manages customer orders.

üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview
The Order Processing Service is a standalone Spring Boot microservice exposing a RESTful API. It adheres to a standard layered architecture:

API Layer (Controller): Handles incoming HTTP requests and responses.

Business Logic Layer (Service): Contains the core business rules and orchestrates operations.

Persistence Layer (Repository): Manages data access operations with the database.

Domain Layer (Entities/Models): Represents the data structure.

üì¶ Component Diagram
The following diagram illustrates the primary components and their interactions within the service:

    A[Client Application] -->|HTTP Request| B(OrderController)

    D -->|Persists/Retrieves Data| F[H2 Database]
    E -->|Persists/Retrieves Data| F
    F -- Reads/Writes --> D
    F -- Reads/Writes --> E

üóÑÔ∏è Data Model
The service primarily manages two entities: Order and OrderItem. These are mapped to database tables using Spring Data JPA.

Order Entity
Represents a customer order.

Field Name

Data Type

Description

Constraints

id

UUID (String)

Unique identifier for the order

Primary Key, Auto-generated

customerId

String

ID of the customer placing the order

Not Null

orderDate

Instant

Timestamp when the order was placed

Not Null

totalAmount

BigDecimal

Total cost of the order

Not Null, Positive

items

List<OrderItem>

List of items included in the order

One-to-Many relationship (Cascade)

OrderItem Entity
Represents an individual item within an order.

Field Name

Data Type

Description

Constraints

id

UUID (String)

Unique identifier for the order item

Primary Key, Auto-generated

productId

String

ID of the product

Not Null

quantity

Integer

Number of units for this product

Not Null, Greater than 0

price

BigDecimal

Price of the individual product at time of order

Not Null, Positive

order

Order

Reference to the parent order

Many-to-One relationship

üíª API Layer: OrderController
OrderController is a Spring @RestController responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and mapping them to appropriate business logic methods. It validates request payloads and formats responses.

Class: com.example.orderservice.controller.OrderController

Responsibilities:

Receive HTTP requests (POST, GET).

Deserialize request bodies into DTOs/Entities.

Delegate processing to OrderService.

Serialize service responses into JSON.

Handle exceptions and return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created, 404 Not Found, 400 Bad Request).

Key Methods:
createOrder(@RequestBody Order order):

Endpoint: POST /api/v1/orders

Input: Order object (from request body).

Process: Calls orderService.createOrder(order).

Output: ResponseEntity<Order> with HTTP 201 Created status.

getOrderById(@PathVariable String orderId):

Endpoint: GET /api/v1/orders/{orderId}

Input: orderId (path variable).

Process: Calls orderService.getOrderById(orderId).

Output: ResponseEntity<Order> with HTTP 200 OK or 404 Not Found if the order doesn't exist.

getAllOrders():

Endpoint: GET /api/v1/orders

Input: None.

Process: Calls orderService.getAllOrders().

Output: ResponseEntity<List<Order>> with HTTP 200 OK.

üìà Business Logic Layer: OrderService
OrderService is a Spring @Service component containing the core business logic for order management. It acts as an intermediary between the OrderController and the data persistence layer.

Class: com.example.orderservice.service.OrderService

Responsibilities:

Implement business rules related to order creation and retrieval.

Orchestrate data operations by interacting with OrderRepository and OrderItemRepository.

Handle transactional boundaries (though not explicitly shown in minimal example, this layer is where @Transactional annotations would typically reside).

Perform any necessary data transformations or calculations (e.g., setting orderDate, validating totalAmount).

Key Methods:
createOrder(Order order):

Generates a unique ID for the Order and its OrderItems.

Sets the orderDate to the current timestamp.

Associates each OrderItem with the parent Order.

Persists the Order (which cascades to OrderItems) using orderRepository.save(order).

Returns the persisted Order object.

getOrderById(String orderId):

Retrieves an Order by ID using orderRepository.findById(orderId).

Returns Order if found, otherwise throws a custom OrderNotFoundException (or returns Optional.empty()).

getAllOrders():

Retrieves all Order entities from the database using orderRepository.findAll().

Returns a List<Order>.

üóÑÔ∏è Persistence Layer: Repositories
The persistence layer uses Spring Data JPA repositories to abstract database interactions.

OrderRepository
Interface: com.example.orderservice.repository.OrderRepository

Extends: JpaRepository<Order, String>

Responsibilities: Provides standard CRUD operations for the Order entity. Spring Data JPA automatically generates the implementation at runtime.

OrderItemRepository
Interface: com.example.orderservice.repository.OrderItemRepository

Extends: JpaRepository<OrderItem, String>

Responsibilities: Provides standard CRUD operations for the OrderItem entity.

‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling
The service employs basic error handling to provide meaningful responses to clients:

OrderNotFoundException: A custom exception thrown by OrderService when an order cannot be found. This would typically be caught by a global exception handler (@ControllerAdvice) to return an HTTP 404 Not Found response.

MethodArgumentNotValidException: Spring's built-in exception for validation failures on request bodies, handled automatically by Spring to return HTTP 400 Bad Request.

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Details
The application uses an in-memory H2 database (jdbc:h2:mem:orderdb) for development and testing. JPA is configured to ddl-auto=update, which means the schema will be automatically generated/updated based on the entity definitions on application startup.

üì¶ Key Dependencies (Design Context)
spring-boot-starter-web: Provides the foundation for building the RESTful API, including embedded Tomcat and Spring MVC.

spring-boot-starter-data-jpa: Enables interaction with relational databases using JPA and Hibernate, simplifying persistence operations through repositories.

h2: Serves as the lightweight, in-memory database for local development and integration testing, avoiding the need for external database setup.

lombok: Reduces boilerplate code (getters, setters, constructors) in entities and DTOs, improving code readability and maintainability.
